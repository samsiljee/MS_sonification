# Blurb:

We are accepting applications for the 2024 Passion in Science Awards through June 1st, 2024. Apply today.

At New England Biolabs, we believe that the pursuit of science is one path to building a greener and more compassionate world.
We are motivated by a set of core, foundational values that are still as true today as they were when we founded the company over 50 years ago: the belief that science should be used to expand our understanding of the world around us; the belief that scientists can also act as humanitarians; the belief that all species, great and small, benefit when we care for the environment; and the belief that great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world.

The Passion in Science Awards recognize those within the scientific community working to solve many of today’s challenges.
We are thrilled to recognize the inspiring work of these individuals.
Individuals are invited to apply for one of the four award categories.

## Project Overview

### Entry Title
(40 characters)
The Sound of Science

### Please provide a high-level sentence description of your project.
Large scientific protein datasets are traditionally interpreted using statistics and graphics, this project explores mass spectrometry proteomics data as immersive audio while honouring the raw data.

### Please upload an image that represents your project.
The image does not have to be a photo, it can be a stock image or vector art that relates to your project. Square dimensions and a minimum resolution of 72dpi are preferred but not required.

### Please provide a more detailed overview of your project.
I’ve been assuming that graphs are the only way to parse complex mass spectrometry datasets,  why not make use of all our senses? My project is born from waveforms giving sounds their characteristic tone, along with the construction of complex waveforms from pure sine waves.
My process involves generating a unique tone for every spectrum in my data; millions of peaks of mass value and intensity. I adapted a reverse Fourier transformation to give each spectrum its characteristic tone. The experimental soundscape is compiled along the acquisition sequence, with the spectral brightness assigned to loudness.
The two-minute excerpt presented here captures the moment when the proteins first start entering the machine. In the left audio channel we can hear different proteins waxing and waning, and in the right seeming chaos as different peaks are rapidly identified.

## Impact

### Why is your project important to you and to others? What is its significance?
In the world of science where increasingly more intellectual work is outsourced to AI, I find it important to connect directly with the raw data. Abstraction from the bulk of large scientific datasets is a necessary reality given the scale of modern mass spectrometry experiments, and AI is promising very interesting developments in the field. However, I doubt AI would spontaneously suggest sonification of this data.
This project brings raw data back into human-interpretable form whilst honouring the original data.
As I notice my life getting increasingly more complex in parallel with the increasing complexity of the datasets I work with, I find it very refreshing to take a step back and approach my work differently. I find the soundscape is intriguingly pleasant to listen to, and I regularly listen to it as I work.
I have been compelled to continue and share this unique work with others.

### Who or what benefits from your project?
Mass spectrometry is a complex technique and this will be a helpful resource for people wanting to learn the fundamental principles. The dramatic, unique presentation of the data allows us to experience different types of spectra, issues with dynamic range, artefact, peak width, and cycle-time. I have found that the art of teaching involves finding the right platform to present these concepts, and every individual has a different approach.
Moreover, this project empowers vision-impaired scientists to engage with the raw data in a meaningful way, who are disadvantaged by assumed visual data presentation. 
This project has sparked many interesting conversations with friends and family who are daunted by science. Something magical has occurred with the emergence of these wondrous soundscapes, prompting discussions on important challenges in science; complexity, scale, and big data.

### Will you continue this project in the future and if so, what are the next steps?
This project has certainly captured my imagination.
I am currently making connections to develop this as a performance and/or interactive installation to bring this experience to a wider audience. Development involves securing funding to bring a complementary visual and physical element to the work. I have had a lot of interest in this project from potential collaborators in the arts, and we are preparing this work to present at the Australasian Computer Music Conference.
I also wish to include this work in my PhD thesis and disseminate it further in the scientific field through publication.
It is also important to me that all my code for this project is open-source and freely available, allowing others to audibly experience their own raw data. To improve accessibility for non-coders, I have produced a web application which I wish to develop further.

## Initiative

### Why did you decide to take this project on?
As the first scientist in an artistic family, the intersection of art and science has always fascinated me. I hold the philosophy that science and art naturally align, as both are methodologies to explore and explain the world around us.
At this point in my PhD journey I am delving into data analysis and this project has really helped me understand the true nature of my raw data, which in turn helps me to troubleshoot and teach others.
I was educated at a Waldorf/Steiner school, with a firm philosophy of taking the holistic approach. Any project we completed whether scientific or otherwise had to include a creative response as part of the project. Consequentially, I grew up writing short plays about chemical reactions, and baking Fibonacci sequence shortbreads!
This project has emerged as my creative response to my biology project, and an essential component of my PhD journey.

### What drives you to succeed?
As a clinician I was confronted with the devastating effects of cancer and limited treatment options, this prompted me to pursue my PhD in lung cancer in order to understand this disease and do my bit to help alleviate the suffering of patients.
It is in my nature understanding exactly why and how things happen and while some are content to have core facilities process their protein samples, I want to get to know the mass spectrometer and my data more intimately.
My datasets are too large even for Excel, so I taught myself the R coding language to grapple with this data. I am very driven by curiosity, and the sheer flexibility of coding has fully unleashed this curiosity.
I found myself becoming deeply fascinated by mass spectrometry and want to take every opportunity to share this joy with others. These soundscapes are the portal to my research and can be shared and enjoyed more widely.

## Originality

### Why is your project different or unique?
The assumed method for understanding mass spectrometry data has always been statistical summarisation and graphical visualisation. This project approaches the data in a radically new way by engaging new senses and challenging the way we deal with mass spectrometry data. While it will not surpass traditional methods to analyse the data for biological insights, it has new applications in teaching, quality control, and engaging a wider audience. Furthermore, it's a novel effort towards bridging the gap between art and science.
While it has been easier to discuss my work with scientists, my non-scientific friends and family who usually find scientific topics intimidating find it a lot easier to engage with tangible audio. Seeing the wonder and joy in the people I share this work with is evidence to its uniqueness and its connection.

### How is this project different from other similar efforts, if any?
Although rarely done, data sonification is not new. However, the use of sonification for proteomics data is a first. In addition, my method shows some fundamental differences in respecting the integrity of the source data.
When looking into sonification of scientific data I was disappointed by the common use of default computer piano sounds to generate tones. It’s very important to me to fully honour the origin of my data by using it as the fundamental sound source.
Other sonification projects commonly use a simplistic sequence of numbers to modulate pitch or other parameters in audio synthesis software. I feel like this doesn't fairly represent the underlying nature of the data.
Unlike other sonifications, this project makes use of the Fourier theorem to produce complex waveforms and hence tones which are fundamentally characteristic of the spectra used to generate them.
