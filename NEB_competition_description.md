# Blurb:

We are accepting applications for the 2024 Passion in Science Awards through June 1st, 2024. Apply today.

At New England Biolabs, we believe that the pursuit of science is one path to building a greener and more compassionate world.
We are motivated by a set of core, foundational values that are still as true today as they were when we founded the company over 50 years ago: the belief that science should be used to expand our understanding of the world around us; the belief that scientists can also act as humanitarians; the belief that all species, great and small, benefit when we care for the environment; and the belief that great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world.

The Passion in Science Awards recognize those within the scientific community working to solve many of today’s challenges.
We are thrilled to recognize the inspiring work of these individuals.
Individuals are invited to apply for one of the four award categories.

# Arts and Creativity

You might be surprised to learn that NEB headquarters is covered in art – from the sculptures that grace the grounds of our campus to the gallery that sits just inside our main entrance – we believe there is a real place for art in science.
Our collection has been curated for 50 years, and it inspires creativity that drives scientific breakthroughs.
We also support local art programs out of a core belief that fostering creativity is essential to self-improvement and social change.

With this award, we recognize the creativity of our customers with the new, unpredictable, and stunning ways that art and science intersect.
