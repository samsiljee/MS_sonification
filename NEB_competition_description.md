# Blurb:

We are accepting applications for the 2024 Passion in Science Awards through June 1st, 2024. Apply today.

At New England Biolabs, we believe that the pursuit of science is one path to building a greener and more compassionate world.
We are motivated by a set of core, foundational values that are still as true today as they were when we founded the company over 50 years ago: the belief that science should be used to expand our understanding of the world around us; the belief that scientists can also act as humanitarians; the belief that all species, great and small, benefit when we care for the environment; and the belief that great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world.

The Passion in Science Awards recognize those within the scientific community working to solve many of today’s challenges.
We are thrilled to recognize the inspiring work of these individuals.
Individuals are invited to apply for one of the four award categories.

# Arts and Creativity

You might be surprised to learn that NEB headquarters is covered in art – from the sculptures that grace the grounds of our campus to the gallery that sits just inside our main entrance – we believe there is a real place for art in science.
Our collection has been curated for 50 years, and it inspires creativity that drives scientific breakthroughs.
We also support local art programs out of a core belief that fostering creativity is essential to self-improvement and social change.

With this award, we recognize the creativity of our customers with the new, unpredictable, and stunning ways that art and science intersect.

# Marking criteria:

Winners will be chosen by an impartial committee comprised of NEB and its subsidiary companies’ employees, providing equal weight of 33.33% to each of the following criteria:

## Project Overview

### Entry Title
(20/40 characters)
The Sound of Science

### Please provide a high-level sentence description of your project.
(131/200 characters)
Large scientific datasets are commonly parsed using statistics and graphics, this project explores proteomics data as a soundscape.

### Please upload an image that represents your project.
The image does not have to be a photo, it can be a stock image or vector art that relates to your project. Square dimensions and a minimum resolution of 72dpi are preferred but not required.

### Please provide a more detailed overview of your project.

## Impact

### Why is your project important to you and to others? What is its significance?
(762/900 characters)

In the world of science where increasingly more intellectual work is outsourced to AI, I find it important to connect fundamentally with the raw data.
Abstraction from the bulk of large scientific datasets is unfortunately a practical reality given the scale of modern mass spectrometry experiments, however this project helps to bring raw data back into human-interpretable form whilst honoring the underlying data.
As I notice my life getting increasingly more complex, in parallel with the increasing complexity of the datasets I work with, I find it very refreshing to take a step back and approach my work differently once in a while. I find the soundscape unusually pleasant to listen to, and regularly have it playing in the background while I do my work.

### Who or what benefits from your project?
(900 characters)

### Will you continue this project in the future and if so, what are the next steps?
(300/900 characters)

This project has certainly captured my imagination. I am currently making connections to develop this as a performance and/or interactive installation to bring this experience to a wider audience. Development involves securing funding to bring a complementary visual and physical element to the work.

## Initiative

### Why did you decide to take this project on?
(244/900 characters)

As the first scientist in an artistic family, the intersection fo art and science has always been dear to me.
I also hold the philosophy that science and art naturally align, as both are methodologies to explore and explain the world around us.
