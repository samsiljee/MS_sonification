# Blurb:

We are accepting applications for the 2024 Passion in Science Awards through June 1st, 2024. Apply today.

At New England Biolabs, we believe that the pursuit of science is one path to building a greener and more compassionate world.
We are motivated by a set of core, foundational values that are still as true today as they were when we founded the company over 50 years ago: the belief that science should be used to expand our understanding of the world around us; the belief that scientists can also act as humanitarians; the belief that all species, great and small, benefit when we care for the environment; and the belief that great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world.

The Passion in Science Awards recognize those within the scientific community working to solve many of today’s challenges.
We are thrilled to recognize the inspiring work of these individuals.
Individuals are invited to apply for one of the four award categories.

# Arts and Creativity

You might be surprised to learn that NEB headquarters is covered in art – from the sculptures that grace the grounds of our campus to the gallery that sits just inside our main entrance – we believe there is a real place for art in science.
Our collection has been curated for 50 years, and it inspires creativity that drives scientific breakthroughs.
We also support local art programs out of a core belief that fostering creativity is essential to self-improvement and social change.

With this award, we recognize the creativity of our customers with the new, unpredictable, and stunning ways that art and science intersect.

# Marking criteria:

Winners will be chosen by an impartial committee comprised of NEB and its subsidiary companies’ employees, providing equal weight of 33.33% to each of the following criteria:

Impact – Why is your project important to you and others? How does it contribute to making a difference in the world? Who or what will benefit from your project?

Initiative – Why did you decide to take this project on? What drives you to succeed?

Originality – Why is your project different or unique? How is this project different from other similar efforts?

## Project Overview

### Entry Title
(40 characters)
The Sound of Science

### Please provide a high-level sentence description of your project.
(200 characters)
Large scientific datasets are commonly parsed using statistics and graphics, this project explores proteomics data as a soundscape.

### Please upload an image that represents your project.
The image does not have to be a photo, it can be a stock image or vector art that relates to your project. Square dimensions and a minimum resolution of 72dpi are preferred but not required.

### Please provide a more detailed overview of your project.

## Impact

### Why is your project important to you and to others? What is its significance?
(900 characters)

In the world of science where increasingly more intellectual work is outsourced to AI, I find it important to connect fundamentally with the raw data.
Abstraction from the bulk of large scientific datasets is unfortunately a practical reality given the scale of modern mass spectrometry experiments, however this project helps to bring raw data back into human-interpretable form whilst honoring the underlying data.
As I notice my life getting increasingly more complex, in parallel with the increasing complexity of the datasets I work with, I find it very refreshing to take a step back and approach my work differently once in a while. I find the soundscape unusually pleasant to listen to, and regularly have it playing in the background while I do my work.

### Who or what benefits from your project?
(900 characters)

Firstly, there is a significant disadvantage to vision-impaired scientist in engaging with the predominantly visual data presentation in science.
This project allows them to engage with the raw data in a meaningful way.
Secondly, in my experiences of teaching I have often found that every individual has a different approach and understanding of the concepts I'm presenting.
The art of teaching involves finding the right analogy to present these concepts.
Mass spectrometry is a complex technique to understand, and the audio in this project clearly presents several important concepts in mass spectrometery in a dramatically different way to ordinary text.
The soundscape allows us to experience the clear differentiation between the MS1 and MS2 spectra, issues with dynamic range, noise and artifact, peak width of the peptides as they elute from the liquid chromatography, cycle-time, and acquisition methods.
This will be a very useful resource for people wanting to learn the fundamental principles of mass spectrometry.

### Will you continue this project in the future and if so, what are the next steps?
(900 characters)

This project has certainly captured my imagination.
I am currently making connections to develop this as a performance and/or interactive installation to bring this experience to a wider audience.
Development involves securing funding to bring a complementary visual and physical element to the work.
I also wish to include this work in my PhD thesis, and disseminate it further in the scientific field through publication.
It is also important to me that all of my code for this project is open-source, allowing others to audibly experience their own raw data.

## Initiative

### Why did you decide to take this project on?
(900 characters)

As the first scientist in an artistic family, the intersection fo art and science has always been dear to me.
I also hold the philosophy that science and art naturally align, as both are methodologies to explore and explain the world around us.
At this point in my PhD journey I am grappling with the analysis of my pilot proteomics data, and finding that there is a lot to discover.
This project has really helped me understand my raw data at a much deeper level, which in turn helps me to troubleshoot and teach others.
I have always been the sort of person who really wants to understand exactly what adn how things happen.
In addition, I beleive that the structure and dimension of mass spectrometry data is particularly well suited to sonification.

### What drives you to succeed?
(900 characters)

Working as a clinician I saw the devastating effects of cancer and limitations of currently available treatment options first-hand.
This prompted me to pursue full-time basic science research in order to develop more effective, equitable, and accessible treatment options for cancer through drug repurposing.
I found myself becoming deeply fascinated by mass spectrometry, and want to take every possible opportunity to share this joy with others.
While it's easy to discuss my work with scientists, my non-science friends and family find it a lot easier to engaging with something tangible to experience.
These soundscapes provide exactly that in a more accessible manner.

## Originality

### Why is your project different or unique?
(900 characters)

The default method for analysing mass spectrometry data is through statistical summarisation and graphical visualisation.
This project approaches the data in a radically new way, engaging new senses, and challenging the way we deal with mass spectrometry data.
While it won't surpass traditional methods to analyse the data for biological insights, it has useful application in quality control of raw data.
More importantly, it is a step towards briding the gap between art and science.

### How is this project different from other similar efforts, if any?
(900 characters)

Although data sonification is rarely done, it is not new. However the use of sonification for proteomics data is novel. In addition, the method by which I achieve the sonifcation is also significantly different.
Other sonification projects commonly use a sequence of numbers to modulate pitch or other parameters in audio synthesis software, often rendered as sounds such a simple piano note.
I feel like this doesn't fairly honor the underlying nature of the data.
This project makes use of the Fourier theorem to produce complex waveforms and hence tones which are fundamentally characteristic of the spectra used to generate them.
